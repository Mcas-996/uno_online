# Project Structure and Operation

This article is intended for developers who want to run, debug, or participate in the development of UNO Star Carnival from source code. The game is a completely offline Rust terminal application, using Ratatui for the interface and Crossterm for cross-platform terminal input and output.

## Environment Requirements

- Windows, macOS, or Linux

- Rust 1.91 or later (recommended to install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/))

- A terminal window with at least `70 × 22` characters

The program does not depend on external services and does not require database or environment variable configuration. When the terminal reaches `70 × 26` characters and supports the corresponding image protocol, the program will automatically display image cards; otherwise, it will safely fall back to colored text cards.

The main call relationships are as follows:

```text
main (terminal initialization and event loop)

├── app (application state and input) ──> core (rules)

└── ui (interface rendering) ────────> graphics ──> card_art

└──> i18n

```

## Running from Source Code

Execute in the repository root directory:

```console
cargo run
```

On the first run, Cargo will download and compile dependencies. After compilation, it will directly enter the settings page, where you can choose player name, number of AIs, difficulty, deck, language, and graphics mode.

To run with an optimized release configuration:

```console
cargo run --release
```

To view command-line help or the current build information without entering the terminal interface:

```console
cargo run -- --help
cargo run -- --version
```

The `--` separator passes the following argument to `uno` instead of Cargo. `-v` and `--version` are equivalent; the output contains both the Cargo package version and the 12-character Git commit for the build. The program does not accept other positional arguments; all game options are configured in the TUI settings page.

After installing with the shell or PowerShell script from the README, run `uno --uninstall` to review the managed paths and enter `y` or `yes` to confirm. `uno --uninstall -y` and `uno --uninstall --yes` skip the prompt. UNO removes `uno`, `uno-update`, and the receipt only when the cargo-dist receipt matches the running executable. Source, Cargo, package-manager, and manually copied builds are refused and must be removed through their original installation method. Uninstalling does not modify the shared `CARGO_HOME/bin`, shell configuration, or Windows PATH registry entry.

## Building and Running Binaries

Debug Build:

```console
cargo build
```
The generated program is located in:

- Windows: `target\debug\uno.exe`

- macOS / Linux: `target/debug/uno`

Release Build:

```console
cargo build --release
```
The corresponding program is located in the `target/release/` directory.

After building, you can query its version from any directory, for example:

```console
target/release/uno --version
```

The version and commit are embedded in the executable at compile time. A release installed with the script in the README can likewise run `uno --version` without reading `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, or `.git` at runtime.

## Development Checks

It is recommended to execute the following before submitting changes:

```console
cargo fmt --check
cargo check
cargo test
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
```

Modifications involving terminal rendering, keyboard interaction, or image protocols should also be verified in the target terminal according to the [manual test checklist](manual-test.md).

## Running Notes

- When the terminal is smaller than `70 × 22`, the program will only display a prompt to resize the window.

- Graphical display requires a terminal of at least `70 × 26`; a full text interface will still work if this requirement is not met.

- You can switch `Graphics` to `Text` in the settings page to force image output disabled.

- SSH sessions will automatically use text display to avoid image protocol escape sequences interfering with the remote terminal.

- Pressing `Ctrl+C`, exiting normally, or experiencing a panic will attempt to restore the terminal's original mode, cursor, and alternate screen state.

If you only want to install and run the released version, please use the installation command in [README](../README.md#quick-start).
